## Install autohotkey on Windows
```
To run an AutoHotkey script at Windows startup, you can place a shortcut to the script in the Windows startup folder. First, locate the script file on your computer. Then, press Win+R to open the run dialog, type "shell:startup" (without quotes) and click oK. This will open the Startup folder. Finally, create a shortcut to your script file and place it in the startup folder. The script will now automatically run every time you start your computer.
